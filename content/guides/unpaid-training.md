# Unpaid Training in Employment

## Definition

Unpaid training refers to periods where employees are required to work or train without receiving compensation, often as a condition of employment.

## Mechanics

### Common Scenarios

- Mandatory training before paid work begins
- "Probationary" periods without pay
- Training that benefits the employer
- Extended orientation periods

### Legal Context

- Varies by jurisdiction
- Must meet specific criteria to be legal
- Often requires careful evaluation
- May violate labor laws

## Warning Signs

### Red Flags

- Extended unpaid periods (weeks/months)
- Performing actual work during training
- Required to generate revenue while unpaid
- Pressure to continue despite no pay
- Vague promises of future compensation

### Questions to Ask

- How long is the training period?
- Will I be performing actual work?
- When does paid employment begin?
- What happens if I don't complete training?
- Is training completion guaranteed?

## Risk Factors

- Financial burden during training
- No guarantee of paid employment
- Time investment without return
- May indicate exploitative practices
- Potential legal violations

## When Training May Be Acceptable

- Short orientation periods
- Clearly defined end date
- Guaranteed transition to paid work
- Training is primarily educational
- Complies with local labor laws
