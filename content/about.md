# About Applicants.io

Applicants.io is a research and aggregation platform focused on helping job candidates make informed decisions before accepting interviews or offers.

We summarize publicly available information about recruiting and compensation patterns that candidates commonly report across online platforms. Our goal is to reduce information asymmetry in hiring funnels by organizing scattered public data into clear, structured summaries.

Applicants.io does not investigate companies, conduct interviews, or make legal determinations. We do not assert that any company has acted unlawfully. A higher risk score reflects the repetition of specific patterns across independent public sources, not the truth of any individual claim.

## What We Analyze

Applicants.io focuses on patterns such as:
- Compensation structures described as commission-only or performance-based
- Interview and onboarding timelines
- Reports of unpaid training or trial periods
- Rebranding or alias usage over time
- Network-style recruiting and management training programs

## What We Do Not Do

Applicants.io does not:
- Host job postings
- Facilitate applications
- Provide legal advice
- Publish unverified accusations
- Act as an employer review forum

## Corrections and Updates

If you are affiliated with a company listed on Applicants.io and believe information is inaccurate or outdated, you may request a review by submitting verifiable corrections. Pages are updated when credible evidence supports a change.

Applicants.io exists to document patterns, not to assign blame.
