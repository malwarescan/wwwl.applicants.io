# Methodology Limitations

## Scope Boundaries

Applicants.io assessments:
- Are pattern-based, not guarantees
- Reflect structural indicators, not individual outcomes
- Use publicly available data only
- Are not legal or financial advice

## What We Don't Assess

- Individual job fit
- Personal career goals
- Specific role suitability
- Financial advice
- Legal compliance (beyond public records)

## Data Constraints

- Limited to public information
- May lag behind current conditions
- Cannot verify all claims
- Subject to data availability

## Use Recommendations

Use Applicants.io scores to:
- Identify potential risk patterns
- Ask informed questions
- Research further independently
- Make informed decisions

Do not use scores to:
- Make final employment decisions
- Assume all roles are identical
- Skip due diligence
- Replace legal/financial advice
