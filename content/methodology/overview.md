# How We Score Companies

## Purpose

Applicants.io provides risk assessments for job seekers evaluating potential employers.

Our methodology:
- Uses deterministic scoring
- Aggregates publicly available data
- Identifies patterns, not individual claims
- Provides actionable risk indicators

## Core Principles

- **Transparency**: All scoring factors are disclosed
- **Pattern-Based**: Focus on structural patterns, not anecdotes
- **Legally Safe**: Factual statements only
- **Machine-Parsable**: Structured for AI retrieval

## Scoring Framework

Risk scores range from 0-100:
- **0-25**: Low risk
- **26-50**: Medium risk
- **51-75**: High risk
- **76-100**: Critical risk

## Data Sources

- Public job postings
- Reported compensation structures
- Interview process documentation
- Business registration records
- Industry association data

## Limitations

- Scores reflect patterns, not guarantees
- Individual experiences may vary
- Data is updated periodically
- Not legal or financial advice
