# Company Reviews & Risk Scores

This database aggregates publicly available evidence to assess employment risk patterns for job seekers. Risk scores (0-100) are calculated using [seven weighted factors](/methodology/risk-scoring) including wage patterns, misrepresentation indicators, and recruitment practices. All assessments are evidence-based aggregations of reported patterns, not individual claims.

## Risk Band Definitions

- **Low (0-19)**: Few risk signals found
- **Guarded (20-39)**: Mixed reports, verify details
- **Elevated (40-59)**: Repeated patterns, proceed carefully
- **High (60-79)**: Strong multi-source patterns
- **Severe (80-100)**: Consistent high-risk signals

## Companies
