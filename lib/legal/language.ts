export const COMPANY_PAGE_DISCLAIMER = `This page summarizes publicly available reports and firsthand accounts found online about a company name that has been mentioned in connection with high-churn, commission-based recruiting or sales roles. Applicants.io does not claim these reports are proven facts, and we do not assert that any company has engaged in unlawful conduct.

Our risk score reflects the presence and repetition of specific recruiting and compensation patterns described in public posts (for example: commission-only pay, unpaid training, group interviews, rapid hiring, frequent rebranding, or network-style "management training" language). A higher score means more independent reports describe similar patterns over time, not that any specific allegation is true.

If you are affiliated with this company and believe information here is inaccurate or incomplete, you can request a review by providing verifiable documentation or corrections. We will update the page when credible evidence supports a change.`

 */
export const METHODOLOGY_EXPLANATION = `Applicants.io uses a deterministic, pattern-based risk scoring system that analyzes publicly available reports and firsthand accounts. Our scoring does not make claims of fact or assert unlawful conduct. Instead, we identify patterns commonly associated with high-churn, commission-based recruiting organizations.

Scores are calculated using a weighted logistic model that considers:
- Frequency of specific recruiting pattern mentions
- Diversity of sources and time periods
- Consistency of reported patterns across independent reports

A higher score indicates more independent reports describe similar patterns over time, not that any specific allegation is true.`
